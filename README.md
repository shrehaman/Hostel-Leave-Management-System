#  Hostel Leave Management System

The Hostel Leave Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP and database management. The system aims to streamline the leave application process for hostel residents, providing an efficient and centralized platform for managing leave requests and approvals. It offers separate interfaces for administrators and students, allowing them to interact with the system based on their roles and responsibilities.

Key Features of the Hostel Leave Management System:

- Student Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface for students to submit leave applications. Students can specify the leave start and end dates, reason for leave, and any supporting documents if required. They can also track the status of their leave applications and receive notifications regarding their leave requests.

- Admin Interface: The system offers an administrative interface for staff members responsible for managing leave requests. Administrators can review, approve, or reject leave applications based on predefined criteria such as availability, hostel policies, and student records. They can also generate reports and view the leave history of individual students or the entire hostel.

- Leave Application Workflow: The system follows a structured workflow for leave application processing. Once a student submits a leave application, it undergoes a review process where administrators evaluate the request and make a decision. The status of the application is updated accordingly, and the student is notified of the outcome.

- Database Management: The system utilizes a database to store and manage student information, leave applications, and related data. The database allows efficient retrieval and storage of information, ensuring data integrity and accessibility for both students and administrators.

- Notifications and Alerts: The system incorporates a notification system to keep students and administrators informed about the status of leave applications. Email notifications or in-app alerts can be sent to notify students of their application status or inform administrators about pending applications.

The Hostel Leave Management System aims to automate and streamline the leave application process in hostels, ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficiency. By leveraging PHP and database management, the system offers a reliable and scalable solution for managing leave requests and approvals.
